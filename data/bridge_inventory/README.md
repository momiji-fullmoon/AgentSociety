# Bridge inventory data artifacts

This directory is reserved for bridge inventory snapshots and normalized exports generated by `scripts/bridge_ingestion.py`.

- `raw/`: immutable GeoJSON and Parquet dumps returned by the BTS feature service. Each run appends timestamped files to preserve reproducibility.
- `processed/`: cleaned tabular outputs and schema summaries suitable for downstream analysis.

Run the ingestion script with `--help` to view configuration options and choose an output prefix or service URL.
